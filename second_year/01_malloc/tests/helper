# To test the project you can run test_script which is going to compile the
# dynamyc library (malloc.so) and compile some tests in test folder + one script
# to link the library when needed (run_sh).
# ex : ./test2 -> use official malloc while ./run_sh ./test2 will use mine


## N.B :
## In able to test the library we need to precise to the linker where he can
## find it. Type the following command or create a script (if so do not
## forget to add $@ add the end of the script)

## LINUX
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
export LD_PRELOAD=libft_malloc.so

## MAC
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES="libft_malloc.so"
export DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE=1
