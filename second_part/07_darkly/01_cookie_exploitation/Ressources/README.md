# Get the flag
Page : `/`

Using the browser inspect tools or any cookie management tools we can see that a cookie with a key `I_am_amin` is set with value `68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327`.
This value looks like a hash or something like it so we can test it on a hash decrypt tool like https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash or https://hashtoolkit.com/
This gave us the result of and **md5** hash from **false**.
So let's hash **true** with **md5** which gave us : `b326b5062b2f0e69046810717534cb09`.
Then we can modify the value of the cookie and reload the page to get the flag.

# Security issue
>Information should be stored in cookies with the understanding that all cookie values are visible to, and can be changed by, the end-user.
[_source_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)

## Fix it
1. Avoid putting auth mecanism in a simple cookie (and in general important informations)
2. Hash the value with a better algorithm (sha256, sha512)
3. Put the httpOnly and Secure attributes to true ensure that cookies are sent securely and are not accessed by unintended parties or scripts
4. Put the sameSite attributes to 'Strict' for auth mecanism
5. Specify domain attribute, expiration time in the more restrictive way (only one path ex: /login, timeout after 15mn)
