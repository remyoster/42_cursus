The Vertex class handles vertex creation.

An instance can be constructed from a list of given points.
new Vertex( array( 'x' => 12.34, 'y' => 12.34, 'z' => 12.34, 'w' => 12.34, 'color' => Color ( array( 'rgb' => 12345)) );
x, y, z are required and w and the color are optionnal.
With: 
- x as abscisse
- y as ordered
- z as depth
- w as homogeneous coordinate
- Color as the results of the class Color

The class provides the following methods :
For each param respectively x, y, z, w, color :
Vertex setAtt($att);
Vertex getAtt($att);
