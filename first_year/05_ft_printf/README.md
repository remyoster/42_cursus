# Ft_printf

## Description
>By now, you must be fed up alternating the ft_putstr and ft_putnbr functions when doing your printing. Are you not allowed to use printf? You can recode yours! It will be a chance for you to discover a feature of the C language – variadic functions – and to practice detailed management of the printing options. You will then be allowed to use your ft_printf in all your future projects.

## Objectives
* Parsing
* Variadic Fonctions

## Skills
* Imperative programming
* Unix
* Rigor
* Algorithms & AI

## Usage
prototype : `int ft_printf(const char *fmt, ...);`
`ft_printf("%s\n%d\n", "Hello World", 42)`
